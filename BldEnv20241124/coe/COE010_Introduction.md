## Introduction

As generative AI technologies evolve and integrate into various aspects of business and society, the need for robust governance, security, and policy management becomes paramount. Establishing a Center of Excellence (COE) for Generative AI Security aims to bring together diverse groups such as security, legal, data science, operations, and end-users to foster collaboration, develop best practices, and ensure safe, efficient deployment of AI capabilities.

### Who is this for?

This document is for CISO security teams and cross-functional leadership to gain an understanding and best practices framework to assist in educating teams on implementing their center of excellence for LLM and Generative AI Application security and adoption.

### Objective

The primary objective of the COE is to develop and enforce security policies and protocols for generative AI applications, facilitate cross-departmental collaboration to harness expertise from various fields, educate and train teams on the ethical and secure use of generative AI technologies, and serve as an advisory body for AI-related projects and initiatives within the organization.

Creating a COE for Generative AI Security is a critical step toward ensuring that generative AI technologies are developed, deployed, and maintained securely and ethically. Through effective collaboration and governance, the COE will play a pivotal role in shaping the future of AI within the organization.
