## Emerging Trends in AI Security

As AI technologies rapidly evolve, so do the security challenges and solutions. Key emerging trends include:

#### AI-powered cybersecurity:
  Using AI to detect and respond to threats more quickly and effectively than traditional methods.
#### Adversarial AI:
  The rise of AI systems designed to attack other AI systems, necessitating robust defenses.
#### Federated learning:
  Enhancing privacy by training AI models on distributed datasets without centralizing the data.
#### Quantum-resistant cryptography:
  Preparing for the potential threat quantum computing poses to current encryption methods.
#### Ethical AI regulations:
  Increasing focus on regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible AI development and deployment.
#### AI supply chain security:
  Growing emphasis on securing the entire AI development pipeline, from data collection to model deployment.
#### Explainable AI (XAI):
  Developing AI systems that can provide clear explanations for their decisions, crucial for security auditing and trust-building.

CoEs must stay abreast of these trends to effectively anticipate and address evolving security challenges in the AI landscape.
