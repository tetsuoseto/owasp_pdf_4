## Setting Overall Objectives and KPIs - Top 5

Establishing a multi-disciplinary Center of Excellence (COE) for trustworthy and secure generative AI adoption requires clear objectives and measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Here are five examples of Objectives and Key Results (OKRs), along with their corresponding KPIs that can serve as a starting point for building an operating plan for your COE.

### Objective 1: Enhance Security Frameworks for Generative AI

This objective focuses on developing and implementing comprehensive security policies tailored to the unique needs of generative AI applications. Full compliance with national and international regulations and reducing the incidence of security breaches are critical. By strengthening the security frameworks, the COE aims to protect AI systems against evolving threats and vulnerabilities, ensuring robust defense mechanisms are in place.

#### Example OKR
  Develop and implement comprehensive security policies specific to generative AI applications.
#### Example KPI
  The number of security policies developed and implemented.

#### Example OKR
  Achieve full compliance with national and international regulations concerning AI security and data privacy
#### Example KPI
  The compliance rate with relevant regulations.

#### Example OKR
  Reduce the incidence of security breaches related to AI by X% within the next year.
#### Example KPI
  Frequency and severity of security breaches involving AI technologies.

### Objective 2: Foster Collaboration and Knowledge Transfer

The goal here is to enhance synergy among various departments within the COE through regular workshops, training sessions, and a centralized knowledge base. This objective seeks to improve team communication and collaboration, fostering an environment where shared resources and collective expertise contribute to innovative security solutions and efficient problem-solving.

#### Example OKR
  Establish regular workshops and training sessions for all departments involved in the COE.
#### Example KPI
  The number of interdepartmental seminars and training sessions conducted.

#### Example OKR
  Create a centralized knowledge base accessible to all COE members, containing up-to-date information on AI security trends and best practices.
#### Example KPI
  Utilization rate of the knowledge base by COE members.

#### Example OKR
  Achieve an X% increase in cross-departmental projects focused on enhancing AI security within the next year.
#### Example KPI
  The number of cross-departmental initiatives launched.

### Objective 3: Build Trust and Transparency with Stakeholders

Building trust and maintaining transparency are pivotal in this objective. By developing and releasing quarterly reports and conducting bi-annual stakeholder meetings, the COE aims to engage openly with all stakeholders, ensuring they are well informed about the organization's AI security initiatives. This approach helps to cultivate a relationship of trust and fosters greater acceptance and support for AI technologies.

#### Example OKR
  Develop and release quarterly reports on the organizationâ€™s AI security status and initiatives.
#### Example KPI
  The number of quarterly reports published.

#### Example OKR
  Conduct bi-annual stakeholder meetings to gather feedback and discuss concerns regarding AI security.
#### Example KPI
  The number of stakeholder meetings held.

#### Example OKR
  Implement and track a stakeholder engagement program aimed at improving transparency and trust.
#### Example KPI
  Engagement levels and feedback scores from stakeholders and public surveys

### Objective 4: Advance Ethical AI and Security Practices

This objective aims to embed ethical considerations deeply within AI operations, ensuring a solid ethical framework guides all AI deployments. The COE commits to promoting responsible AI usage that aligns with security guidelines and organizational ethics by developing ethical guidelines, conducting annual audits, and increasing awareness of these standards.

#### Example OKR
  Develop and enforce a set of ethical and security guidelines tailored for generative AI use within the organization.
#### Example KPI
  The number of ethical guidelines developed and implemented.

#### Example OKR
  Conduct an annual audit to ensure adherence to ethical AI and security standards and practices.
#### Example KPI
  Results of the ethics and security audit, detailing compliance and areas for improvement.

#### Example OKR
  Achieve an X% increase in awareness and understanding of ethical AI principles among employees by the end of the year.
#### Example KPI
  Increase in employee scores on AI security and ethical AI awareness assessments.

### Objective 5: Optimize AI Performance and Reliability

Optimizing the performance and reliability of AI systems is crucial to this objective. It involves enhancing AI system accuracy, reducing error rates, and ensuring systems can operate effectively under various conditions. The COE aims to deliver high-performing AI applications that stakeholders can consistently rely on by deploying tools and updates that improve system efficiency.

#### Example OKR
  Reduce error rates in AI systems by 25% over the next 12 months.
#### Example KPI
  Reduction percentage in error rates of AI and AI-based applications.

#### Example OKR
  Implement a system for continuous monitoring and real-time analysis of AI system performance.
#### Example KPI
  Implementation status of the continuous monitoring system.

#### Example OKR
  Develop and deploy at least two new tools or updates that improve the efficiency and reliability of AI operations.
#### Example KPI
  Number and impact of tools or updates deployed for improving AI performance.
