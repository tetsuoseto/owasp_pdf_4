  >dodgerblue|white|left|12|16 LLM01: Prompt Injection
  >azure|black|justified|10|12 Crafty inputs can manipulate a Large Language Model, causing unintended actions. Direct injections overwrite system prompts, while indirect ones manipulate inputs from external sources.

  >dodgerblue|white|left|12|16 LLM02: Insecure Output Handling
  >azure|black|justified|10|12 This vulnerability occurs when an LLM output is accepted without scrutiny, exposing backend systems. Misuse may lead to severe consequences like XSS, CSRF, SSRF, privilege escalation, or remote code execution.

  >dodgerblue|white|left|12|16 LLM03: Training Data Poisoning
  >azure|black|justified|10|12 This occurs when LLM training data is tampered, introducing vulnerabilities or biases that compromise security, effectiveness, or ethical behavior. Sources include Common Crawl, WebText, OpenWebText, & books.

  >dodgerblue|white|left|12|16 LLM04: Model Denial of Service
  >azure|black|justified|10|12 Attackers cause resource-heavy operations on Large Language Models leading to service degradation or high costs. The vulnerability is magnified due to the resource-intensive nature of LLMs and unpredictability of user inputs.

  >dodgerblue|white|left|12|16 LLM05: Supply Chain Vulnerabilities
  >azure|black|justified|10|12 LLM application lifecycle can be compromised by vulnerable components or services, leading to security attacks. Using third-party datasets, pre- trained models, and plugins can add vulnerabilities.

  >dodgerblue|white|left|12|16 LLM06: Sensitive Information Disclosure
  >azure|black|justified|10|12 LLM’s may reveal confidential data in its responses, leading to unauthorized data access, privacy violations, and security breaches. It’s crucial to implement data sanitization and strict user policies to mitigate this.

  >dodgerblue|white|left|12|16 LLM07: Insecure Plugin Design
  >azure|black|justified|10|12 LLM plugins can have insecure inputs and insufficient access control. This lack of application control makes them easier to exploit and can result in consequences like remote code execution.

  >dodgerblue|white|left|12|16 LLM08: Excessive Agency
  >azure|black|justified|10|12 LLM-based systems may undertake actions leading to unintended consequences. The issue arises from excessive functionality, permissions, or autonomy granted to the LLM-based systems.

  >dodgerblue|white|left|12|16 LLM09: Overreliance
  >azure|black|justified|10|12 Systems or people overly depending on LLMs without oversight may face misinformation, miscommunication, legal issues, and security vulnerabilities due to incorrect or inappropriate content generated by LLMs.

  >dodgerblue|white|left|12|16 LLM10: Model Theft
  >azure|black|justified|10|12 This involves unauthorized access, copying, or exfiltration of proprietary LLM models. The impact includes economic losses, compromised competitive advantage, and potential access to sensitive information.

### OWASP Resources

Using LLM solutions expands an organization's attack surface and presents new challenges, requiring special tactics and defenses. It also poses problems that are similar to known issues, and where there are already established cybersecurity procedures and mitigations. Integrating LLM cybersecurity with an organization's established cybersecurity controls, processes, and procedures allows an organization to reduce its vulnerability to threats.

### MITRE Resources

The increased frequency of LLM threats emphasizes the value of a resilience-first approach to defending an organization's attack surface. Existing TTPS is combined with new attack surfaces and capabilities in LLM Adversary threats and mitigations. MITRE maintains a well-established and widely accepted mechanism for coordinating opponent tactics and procedures based on real-world observations.

Coordination and mapping of an organization's LLM Security Strategy to MITRE ATT&CK and MITRE ATLAS allows an organization to determine where LLM Security is covered by current processes such as API Security Standards or where security holes exist.

MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge) is a framework, collection of data matrices, and assessment tool that was made by the MITRE Corporation to help organizations figure out how well their cybersecurity works across their entire digital attack surface and find holes that had not been found before. It is a knowledge repository that is used all over the world. The MITRE ATT&CK matrix contains a collection of strategies used by adversaries to achieve a certain goal. In the ATT&CK Matrix, these objectives are classified as tactics. The objectives are outlined in attack order, beginning with reconnaissance and progressing to the eventual goal of exfiltration or impact.

MITRE ATLAS, which stands for "Adversarial Threat Landscape for Artificial Intelligence Systems," is a knowledge base that is based on real-life examples of attacks on machine learning (ML) systems by bad actors. ATLAS is based on the MITRE ATT&CK architecture, and its tactics and procedures complement those found in ATT&CK.
