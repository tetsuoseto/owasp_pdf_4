## Example Implementation Phases/Timeline

Every organization is different. However, taking a phased approach to developing and rolling out your COE can help ensure better alignment between functions, a clear setting of expectations, and a smooth transition into a group that provides actionable insights to help secure AI applications and ease adoption.

This example phased timeline is designed to provide a structured approach starting point based on previous implementation experience for setting up and operationalizing your COE.

This will help to ensure that each step is planned and executed with attention to detail, enabling the organization to effectively manage and secure its generative AI initiatives. The approach and framework will need to be tuned to your specific company process, resourcing and approach.

### Phase 1: Planning and Setup (Months 1-3)

During the initial phase, the focus is on establishing the foundational structure of the COE. This involves assembling a leadership team from across key departments, defining the specific roles and responsibilities within the COE, and developing initial security frameworks and policies. The objective is to create a robust organizational structure that supports effective communication and collaboration across diverse teams, setting the stage for the subsequent integration and development phases.

#### Key Actions
- Assemble leadership teams and define the structure of the COE.
- Establish clear roles and responsibilities for all involved departments.
- Develop initial security frameworks and compliance guidelines.

### Phase 2: Integration and Development (Months 4-6)

This phase is critical for integrating AI security protocols into existing systems and fostering interdepartmental collaboration. The COE will implement comprehensive training programs to ensure all members are up-to-date with the latest security practices and technologies. Additionally, the launch of initial interdepartmental projects aims to enhance collaborative efforts and begin the practical application of the developed security frameworks, thereby testing and refining these strategies in real-world scenarios.

#### Key Actions
- Implement training and development programs for COE members.
- Begin integration of AI security protocols into existing systems.
- Launch initial interdepartmental projects to promote collaboration.

### Phase 3: Operationalization (Months 7-9)

The COE becomes fully functional in the operationalization phase with all systems and processes actively running. Regular monitoring and reporting mechanisms are established to track the effectiveness of AI security measures. Security audits and risk assessments are conducted to identify any vulnerabilities and to ensure compliance with the established security protocols. This phase is crucial for adjusting operational workflows based on feedback and ensuring that the COE's activities are effectively enhancing AI security.

#### Key Actions
- Fully operationalize the COE, with all systems and processes in place.
- Start regular monitoring and reporting of AI security measures.
- Conduct first round of security audits and risk assessments.

### Phase 4: Evaluation and Expansion (Months 10-12)

The final phase focuses on evaluating the COE's effectiveness through comprehensive reviews and feedback mechanisms. Based on the outcomes of these evaluations, adjustments are made to policies and strategies. Additionally, plans for scaling COE activities are developed to include additional AI projects and initiatives, aiming to broaden the scope and impact of the COE's work. This phase ensures that the COE remains dynamic and adaptable to new challenges and opportunities.

#### Key Actions
- Evaluate the effectiveness through feedback and performance metrics.
- Adjust policies and strategies based on outcomes and new industry insights.
- Plan for the scaling of COE activities and inclusion of additional AI projects.

Beyond the initial year, the COE engages in continuous improvement activities to keep abreast of the latest developments in AI and cybersecurity. This includes updating training programs, protocols, and security measures and maintaining open lines of communication with all stakeholders. Continuous monitoring of the AI landscape helps the COE proactively address emerging threats and innovate security solutions, ensuring the long-term resilience and trustworthiness of AI systems.
