## Creating the COE Structure

Creating an AI Security center of excellence (COE) for managing and securing generative AI applications involves strategic planning and collaboration across multiple departments.

The leadership team is comprised of heads from security, legal, data science, and operations. This team is responsible for making strategic decisions and directing the COE. Specific working groups focused on key areas such as Security and Compliance, Legal and Regulatory Affairs, Data Management and Analytics, Operational Integration, and End-User Engagement.

The overall group is tasked with addressing specific challenges and delivering solutions relevant to their expertise, which include:
- Policy Development: Creating security policies tailored to generative AI.
- Risk Assessment and Management: Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.
- Training and Awareness: Conduct regular training sessions and workshops to inform all stakeholders about best practices and emerging threats.
- Research and Development: Stay abreast of the latest developments in AI and security to continuously refine strategies and tools.
- Stakeholder Engagement: Regularly involve end-users and other stakeholders in
decision-making to ensure the COE's initiatives align with user needs and organizational goals.

### COE Considerations

Establishing a multidisciplinary team within a COE presents several challenges that need careful management. In addition to addressing these challenges and enhancing the COE's capabilities, leveraging external expertise can be highly beneficial. With diverse expertise and backgrounds, integrating professionals from security, legal, data science, and operations can lead to conflicts due to differing priorities and perspectives. Aligning these diverse viewpoints towards common objectives is critical.

#### Some Examples of Internal Challenges
- Communication Barriers: Effective communication among team members with varied professional languages and methodologies can be difficult. Establishing a common language or set of terminologies is essential for seamless collaboration.
- Resistance to Change: Individuals from different departments may resist new workflows or changes that disrupt traditional processes. Managing change effectively and ensuring buy-in from all stakeholders is crucial.
- Resource Allocation: Competing for resources among different departments can create friction. Transparent and equitable resource distribution policies need to be established.
- Skill Gaps: As generative AI is a relatively new and rapidly evolving area, there may be significant gaps in the necessary skills among existing staff, which can hinder the COE's effectiveness.

#### Utilizing External Expertise

Leveraging external expertise can prove crucial to enhancing the capabilities of the Center of Excellence (COE) and addressing its challenges. Engaging consultants and advisors specializing in AI security, legal regulations related to AI, and data ethics can provide the COE with critical insights and guidance, helping shape effective policies and procedures. Additionally, partnering with external training providers can address skill gaps within the team by offering specialized training in AI and cybersecurity, ensuring that all members are proficient in the latest technologies and industry best practices.

Collaborating with technology partners, such as tech companies and vendors, offers COE access to advanced tools and platforms that boost operational capabilities. Furthermore, forming partnerships with academic and research institutions facilitates continuous learning and helps the COE stay abreast of new developments in the field of generative AI.

Engaging with industry groups and networks also aids in understanding broader trends, gathering insights from similar initiatives, and adopting industry-wide best practices, all of which contribute to the strategic growth and effectiveness of the
